# What the heck's a Canvas Port?
The original version of this project was created in processing. That was great becausde It made laying down the groundwork very easy. However, as time went on I noticed Processing was named that because it used a lot of it (processing power. get it? haha).

Therefore, one weekend I decided to port the original game to a canvas. My computer's fans no longer go wild when I have more than 3 planets on the screen.

## Controls:
- Click anywhere to create new planets
- Press ESC to remove all planets
- Press P to toggle lines being created
